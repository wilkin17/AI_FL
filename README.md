Run instructions:
Download all provided files. Ensure that Train_Aggregated.csv and Test_Aggregated.csv are in the same level as the server and client files. Before running the server and the clients, make sure that the variable "num_rounds" matches for both. First run the server. Then, run either the FedAvg_client.py or the FedDyn_client.py. When it is done, it will give you a csv file that you can use for data analysis.
